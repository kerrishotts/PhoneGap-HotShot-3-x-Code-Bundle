This repository stores the code for the book entitled PhoneGap HotShot 3.x Mobile Application Development published by Packt Publishing. You can purchase the book at http://www.packtpub.com/... (pre-release, no site yet)

The code herein is not listed in chapter order but by project name. A lookup from chapter number to project name is provided below.

Furthermore, the code herein is not a complete Cordova project. The build artifacts (namely the `platforms`, `plugins`, etc., directories) are ignored. Only the `www` and `merges` directories are provided. In order to execute any of these projects, you'll need to create a new Cordova project and copy the relevent files from this repository into your project.
